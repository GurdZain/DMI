1.Biometrics Identification Module Introduction
	The biometric identification module uses human faces, fingerprints, iris and behavioral features (such as handwriting, sound, gait, etc.) to  do the identify verification. This module firstly explores the development and application of face recognition technology.

2.Face Recognition 
#Function Introduction

	It identifies the face in the image and outlines the face area, and returns the rectangle frame coordinates of the detected face after the face is detected. The key points of the five facial features in the image are extracted, and the parameter of the key points is output. On the basis of face recognition, some attributes such as sex, age, expression and glasses are identified, and the deep learning features can be returned.

3.Face Matching & Living Recognition
#Function Introduction

	Cameras are used to collect images or video streams containing human faces, and detect and track faces automatically in the image, and then do a series of detection of the captured face. The feature data extracted from the face images are searched and matched with the feature data stored in the database. By setting a threshold, when the similarity exceeds this threshold, the matching result is output. Face recognition is to compare the facial features that need to be recognized with the obtained facial feature data, and to identify the face identity information according to the similarity degree.
